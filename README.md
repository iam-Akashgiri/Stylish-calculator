# Stylish-calculator
calculator by only using html,css

A basic project made by usning only HTML, CSS and very few function of JS,
we tried to keep the code simple and shorter as much as possible,


In html we used form tag and post method to submit the form and take a response in 
empty input tag named as answer and given a id as a display.

In css we used color gradient method for back ground color designing and a shodow 
for form container also we given a bit ammount of hovering effect on each button .


in the end we used a eval function to calculate our eqn.
